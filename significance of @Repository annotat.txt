significance of @Repository annotation:-
======================================
The @Repository annotation is a specialized Spring stereotype annotation used to indicate that a class is a repository or a data access object (DAO). It is one of the four stereotype annotations in Spring, alongside @Controller, @Service, and @Component. The primary significance of the @Repository annotation lies in the context of Spring's Dependency Injection and Persistence frameworks. Let's explore its significance:

-> Automatic Bean Detection and Registration:
   When using component scanning (enabled by @ComponentScan) in a Spring application, Spring automatically detects classes annotated with  
   @Repository and registers them as Spring beans in the application context. This allows other components to use these beans without the  
   need for manual configuration.

-> Exception Translation:
   One of the notable features of the @Repository annotation is that it automatically translates persistence-specific exceptions into  
   Spring's DataAccessException. This allows for a consistent and unified approach to exception handling across different data access 
   technologies, like JDBC, JPA, Hibernate, etc.

-> Layer Separation and Clearer Codebase:
   By using @Repository, you explicitly mark a class as a data access component, making it easier to distinguish and maintain different 
   layers of your application. This promotes a clear separation between business logic (usually found in @Service components) and data 
   access operations.

-> Transactional Behavior:
   In combination with @Transactional annotation, the @Repository annotation can define transactional behavior for data access operations.   
   When methods of a @Repository class are annotated with @Transactional, Spring automatically handles transactions for those methods, 
   ensuring data integrity and consistency.

-> Spring Data JPA Integration:
   In the context of Spring Data JPA, the @Repository annotation is optional. Spring Data JPA provides its own specialized annotation 
   @RepositoryDefinition, which is implicitly added to all JPA repository interfaces. However, using @Repository alongside Spring Data JPA 
   repositories is a common practice to maintain consistency and clarify the purpose of the class.
