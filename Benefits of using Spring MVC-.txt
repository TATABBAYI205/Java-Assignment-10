Benefits of using Spring MVC:-
============================

-> Loose Coupling: The framework promotes loose coupling between the Model, View, and Controller, making it easier to maintain and modify 
   different components independently.

-> Extensibility: Spring MVC is designed to be easily extensible, allowing developers to plug in various components to customize the 
   behavior of their applications.

-> Testability: The MVC architecture enables developers to test their applications more effectively by allowing separate testing of each 
   component.

-> Annotation-based Configuration: With the introduction of annotations, configuration has become more straightforward and less XML-heavy.

-> Support for RESTful Web Services: Spring MVC provides features to build RESTful web services, allowing developers to expose their   
   application functionalities via standard HTTP methods.

-> Internationalization and Localization: The framework supports internationalization and localization, making it easier to develop 
   applications that cater to a global audience.

-> Integration with other Spring modules: Spring MVC seamlessly integrates with other Spring modules, such as Spring Security for 
   authentication and authorization.
